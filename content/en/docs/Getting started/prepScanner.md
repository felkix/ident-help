     At this point the docking station and your scanner should be unboxed. The scope
     of delivery should be the scanner, the charging station, the power supply, the
     smartphone attachments and 4 socket adapters.

* Choose the adapter that suits your country and slide it into the power
supply.

* Then connect the power supply to the docking station and plug it into the
socket.
* The scanner should arrive ready to use but you should charge it before use.
* You can let it slide in between the two arms of the docking station, and it will
be charged automatically.
* While the scanner is charging, you can prepare the smartphone with the
magnetic clips or screws. To do this, place the magnetic clips in the square
recesses and remove the protective film of the adhesive surface. At best,
you have a protective case for your smartphone and can now press it on the
charging area. Make sure that the inductive charging function is
optimally used.
* Alternatively, you can mount the protective case by using the screws.
