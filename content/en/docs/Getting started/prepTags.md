Before attaching your tags, you should check the administration area of the
SKPident Browser whether these are listed in the menu **[untagged tags]**.

The SKPident tags are mostly made of metal and contain a chip in the middle, it
should be protected from buckling and generally mechanical movement.

When you want to attach the Tag, you can use our SKPident repair Strips. If you
produce new tarpaulins, you can weld in the Tag directly. It is very useful to make
guidelines for this process, so that they are attached to each tarpaulin the same
way. This simplifies the process of scanning.
