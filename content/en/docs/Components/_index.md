# Hardware

## Scanner

The SKPident Scanner has 4 antennas and the QR/Barcode reader. The
antennas have a range of up to 8 meters.

It is connected to the smartphone via the Bluetooth interface. The Smartphone
can be attached to the inductive loading area of the scanner with magnetic clips or
screws. 
The scanner sends the electromagnetic waves and receives the
information stored in the tags. You can activate the Scanner by pressing the
Trigger or the in-App Buttons.

## Tags

SKPident tags are available in various styles, for example to incorporate them into
tarpaulins or attach them to profiles and ropes. However, the technology is always
the same.

RFID is the abbreviation for "radio frequency identification". To uniquely identify
objects that are equipped with a tag, electromagnetic waves are emitted by the
antennas of the scanner.

There are also antennas in the Tag. They pick up the signal and generate a small
electric charge, through the waves. This charge allows them, to return the ID,
stored on a chip, without an additional powersource. A Tag has over 100000
reading cycles.

# Software

## Browser

The browser application is the management tool. The most relevant Interface is
the administration area. It can be seen in the picture;

It is also possible to read and assign tags here, but you have to enter IDs manually.
The administration area is the heart of the system. 

The functions in the administration area are described in detail in the chapter Working with SKPident.
SKPident Browser is optimized for the office.

## Application

The scanner does not work without a smartphone. Currently there is only the iOS
version, so you need to have an iPhone. You can download the Application via the
following QR code.

The SKPident app is optimized for mobile use. Scanning and mobile tag
assignment are the main tasks. For this purpose, the scanner communicates with
the smartphone via Bluetooth.

Particular attention has been paid to ease of use, so that activities in the warehouse can be carried out quickly and easily.

The app is compatible with all popular iOS devices.
We recommend the use of an Ipad Mini or an iphone with at least 6 inch screen
diagonal.
