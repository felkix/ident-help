## Hardware

![Image](<scanner.png>)

The SKPident Scanner has 4 antennas and the QR/Barcode reader. The
antennas have a range of up to 8 meters.

It is connected to the smartphone via the Bluetooth interface. The Smartphone
can be attached to the inductive loading area of the scanner with magnetic clips or
screws. 
The scanner sends the electromagnetic waves and receives the
information stored in the tags. You can activate the Scanner by pressing the
Trigger or the in-App Buttons.


## Software

SKPident tags are available in various styles, for example to incorporate them into
tarpaulins or attach them to profiles and ropes. However, the technology is always
the same.

RFID is the abbreviation for "radio frequency identification". To uniquely identify
objects that are equipped with a tag, electromagnetic waves are emitted by the
antennas of the scanner.

There are also antennas in the Tag. They pick up the signal and generate a small
electric charge, through the waves. This charge allows them, to return the ID,
stored on a chip, without an additional powersource. A Tag has over 100000
reading cycles.
